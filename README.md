# File Encryption and Decryption Web Application

This is a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting files.

## Features

- File selection: Users can choose a file from their local system for encryption or decryption.
- Encryption: The selected file is encrypted using the AES algorithm with a provided key or password.
- Decryption: Encrypted files can be decrypted using the same key or password used for encryption.
- Download: Users can download the encrypted or decrypted file after the process is complete.
- User-provided key/password: The application allows users to enter their own key or password for encryption and decryption.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for structuring the web pages and creating the user interface.
- CSS: Used for styling the web pages and making them visually appealing.
- JavaScript: Used for handling the file encryption and decryption logic.
- AES Algorithm: Used for encrypting and decrypting the files securely.
